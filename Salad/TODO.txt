CPP Code Organization:
	- Sort out includes, put core classes in salad.h like Entity.h, dont include in header files!!! causes circle references

2D Renderer:

	Sprite Animation
		DONE - Either make every sprite an animated sprite
		DONE - Add a SpriteRenderer that can be transformed into a component for the ECS system that will hold a sprite animator(not required), and a sprite.

		- Sprite Switching, Sprite Manager???
		- Could delete texture map and store the data in the sprite itself

	Tile Maps
		- Derived from Texture maps or just use texture maps when no extra functionality is required.
		- Tile animations, global animation system no per tile animation

	Batching?

	UI Elements
		- Default ui elements(simpleTexture, text, buttons, text boxes, dropdown stuff, checkboxes)
		- UI anchoring

Entity Component System (ECS)
	? Update entity components trough a "Component Manager", might help with lua script performance amongst other things

Scenes - ???
Physics - ???
